# Microservice-architecture
- As a collection of small independent and loosely coupled services
- Each service focus on single feature
- Can be developed and deployed independently
- Faster development
- Better fault isolation
- Can use different programming language for each servcie
- New feature can be added easily without affecting entire application

## How Microservices communicates with each others ?
1. Synchronous communication (e.g, HTTP requests)
2. Asynchronous communication || Message broker(e.g, rabbitMQ)
